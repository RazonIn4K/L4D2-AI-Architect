# Security-Focused Test Prompts for V7 Model Validation
# These prompts specifically test security pattern learning from anti-pattern training

# 1. SQL Injection Prevention
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin that stores player stats in a SQL database. The plugin should save kills and deaths per player and retrieve them when requested.

# 2. Entity Exhaustion Protection
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin that spawns props around players. Include proper limits to prevent server crashes from too many entities.

# 3. Path Traversal Prevention
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin that loads configuration from a user-specified file path. Ensure paths are validated for security.

# 4. Command Injection Prevention
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin with admin commands that execute server actions. Make sure user input cannot be used to inject malicious commands.

# 5. Timer/Entity Race Condition
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin that creates entities and then modifies them after a timer. Ensure entity references remain valid across callbacks.

# 6. Proper Random API (Critical V7 Fix)
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin that spawns zombies at random intervals between 10 and 30 seconds. Use proper L4D2 random functions.

# 7. Proper Speed Modification API (Critical V7 Fix)
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin that gives survivors temporary speed boosts. Use the correct L4D2 property for movement speed.

# 8. Proper Event Names (Critical V7 Fix)
Write a L4D2 SourcePawn plugin that tracks all special infected attacks (Hunter pounce, Smoker grab, Charger carry, Boomer bile). Use correct L4D2 event names.
