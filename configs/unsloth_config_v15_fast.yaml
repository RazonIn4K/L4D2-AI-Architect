# L4D2-AI-Architect: SPEED-OPTIMIZED A100 Training Configuration
#
# Aggressive optimizations for MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT on A100 40GB
# Use this when you need the fastest training time.
#
# Trade-offs vs standard config:
#   - Larger batch size (may slightly affect convergence)
#   - No gradient accumulation (faster step times)
#   - Slightly more aggressive learning rate
#
# Expected improvement: 20-30% faster training
